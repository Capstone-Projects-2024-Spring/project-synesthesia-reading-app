Specifically, the app focuses on grapheme-color synesthesia in which graphemes elicit specific colors that remain consistent over time. Neurological research on grapheme-color synesthetes has indicated that reading text that is colored in a way congruent with their expectations help them process it faster. [AppName] allows people who have grapheme-color synesthesia to read text in their personal color associations. Although to non-synesthetes, text printed in a variety of colors may seem chaotic, to a grapheme-color synesthete graphemes printed in colors harmonious with their natural color association just feels right."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"[Appname] uses a combination of machine learning and user feedback to map the synesthete's word-color associations. Then, they can upload any document and [AppName] will color each word according to the user's input and display the document to them. The user can then read it, aided by the word colorings matching their expectations, as well as adjust other features of the text. The user can change the font, adjust the text's size, and bold sections, all through the intuitive user interface. The user can make notes, as well as download the document along with notes for offline reading and sharing. If there is a mistake in the coloration, users can adjust it quickly and easily, allowing for the synesthete to have total control over how documents are presented to them."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"[AppName] can also be helpful for helping neurodivergent people to read more easily, as synesthesia co-occurs with neurological differences and learning differences. Specifically: Autism (including Asperger syndrome), ADHD, dyslexia, and dyspraxia. In adults the rate of synesthesia has been found to be three times higher in people with autism (18.9%) compared to people without autism (7.22%). Research has also found that there is a co-occurrence of synesthetic experiences in individuals with ADHD, dyslexia, and dyspraxia. 17% of individuals with ADHD, 9% of dyslexics, and 14% of dyspraxics report synesthetic experiences. Synesthetic experiences are also reported in 18% of individuals with both ADHD and dyslexia as well as 37% individuals with both ADHD and dyspraxia. This co-occurrence with disabilities suggests that [AppName] can assist some of those with learning differences, as they are more likely to have grapheme-color synethesia and thus more likely to benefit from seeing text that matches their natural word-color associations."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"conceptual-design",children:"Conceptual Design"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"[AppName] will be a progressive web application, available on all platforms through a web prowser or downloadable as an app. We will be using ReactJS to build up the user interface.
