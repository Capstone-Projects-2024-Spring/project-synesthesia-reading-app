# Version Control

<p>The development of ColorInSync will use git for version control. A definitive version of the codebase will be maintained within the "main" branch hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Capstone-Projects-2024-Spring/project-synesthesia-reading-app).</p>
<p>Seperate branches will be created for each independent component and then integrated into the definitive codebase through merging into the main branch. Merges into the main branch must be approved by a member of the development team other than the individual who initated the merge.</p>
